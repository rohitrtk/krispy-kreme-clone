			<p>
				Since early in Krispy Kreme’s history, many schools, charities and not-for-profit organizations have raised funds through selling Krispy Kreme Original Glazed doughnuts! Traditional Original Glazed Doughnut Sales by the dozen is how we can help you achieve your fundraising goals!

			<p>
				<span class="font-bold">Krispy Kreme</span> offers our doughnuts to non-profit groups at a reduced price, which are then resold for full retail price, or slightly higher. Pre-selling doughnuts to family, friends and neighbours or selling doughnuts at high-traffic areas such as shopping centers or community festivals can generate significant funds.

		<section class="md:px-40 p-5 flex flex-col justify-start items-center gap-5">
			<p>
				To participate in FUNDRAISING in Canada*, the first step is to contact the Krispy Kreme store that you would like to pick up the doughnuts from.
			</p>
			<p class="font-bold">
				PLEASE NOTE THAT FUNDRAISING DOUGHNUTS ARE AVAILABLE ON A LIMITED BASIS SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU CONFIRM AVAILABILITY FOR YOUR REQUIRED DATE PRIOR TO INITIATING ANY SALES.

				After that, download, print and submit a FUNDRAISING Application / Purchase Order Agreement along with a letter on your not-for-profit organization’s letterhead to your local Krispy Kreme store.

				The letter should acknowledge the fundraiser, stating how the raised funds will be used, and signed by an organizational executive. A member of our team will contact you within 3 business days of receiving your completed application and letter, to assist with the planning and execution of your fundraiser.
